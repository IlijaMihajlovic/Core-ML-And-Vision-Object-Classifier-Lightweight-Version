Core ML and Vison object Classifier With An Lightweight Trained Model.
The model is trained and tested with Create ML straight from Xcode Playgrounds with the dataset I provided.

When I builded my classifier i split the dataset in to 80-20 ratio. Approximately 80% of the dataset goes to Training Data and the remaining goeso to Testing Data. That way, the classifier has more data to train off of. 
This whole project is created completely programmatically without Storyboards and Interface Builder.

## Side Note
* Currently, I do not have an iPhone, so I'm unable to test the app on a physical device. I apologize in advance for maybe possible bugs.

   Kind regards,

   Ilija 🖖 😄
